  <summary><strong>üìù Skills</strong></summary><br />

In this project, I learned to:

- Using JSX in React;

- Correctly use the `render()` method to render your components;

- Use `import` to bring components into different files;

- Create class components in React;

- Create multiple components from an array;

- Make use of `props` correctly;

- Make use of `PropTypes` to validate the `props of a component`.

## 6. Render a list with the planets of the Solar System ‚úîÔ∏è

<details>
  <summary>Render a list of Solar System planets inside the <code>SolarSystem</code> component.</summary>

- Use the `PlanetCard` component to render each item in the list of planets;

- You will find the list with the names and images of each planet in the Solar System in the `src/data/planets.js` file;
- You must import the list into the `SolarSystem` component using the code:

```javascript
import planets from "../data/planets";
```

- The list of planets is an _array_ of objects in the following format:

```javascript
{
  name: "Planet name",
  image: "path-to-planet-image"
}
```

- For each planet in the list, you should render a `PlanetCard` component, passing the `name` attribute to the `planetName` prop and the `image` attribute to the `planetImage` prop.
